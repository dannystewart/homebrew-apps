# Homebrew Apps

My personal Homebrew tap for my macOS applications.

## Current Apps

- [**volumehud**](https://github.com/dannystewart/volumeHUD) - macOS volume HUD from pre-Tahoe

### How can I install the apps?

If you just want a single app:

```bash
brew install dannystewart/apps/<cask>
```

Or if you want to have ready access to this and future apps:

```bash
# If you want ready access to this and future apps
brew tap dannystewart/apps
brew install --cask <cask>
```

You can check out `brew help` or [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh) for more info.
